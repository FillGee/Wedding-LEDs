# Wedding-LEDs
New project involving multiple ESP8266s using ESP-NOW to communicate between them, analyze music from a MSGEQ7 and set multiple neopixel rings based on the music.

After learning a lot doing my other LED project, I decided to toy around with the idea of creating neopixel rings running off battery power and communicating wirelessly as wedding centerpieces. Hopefully the result isnt too complex, though there has been a bit of a learning curve with ESP8266 and ESP-NOW

Documents/projects that helped along the way:
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/network/esp_now.html (api-reference for ESP-NOW)

https://github.com/leonyuhanov/ESP-NOW-TX-RX/blob/master/Transmiter/Transmiter.ino (minimal usage of ESP-NOW, just the basics)

https://github.com/SensorsIot/ESP-Now-Tests/blob/master/ESPNow_Master_ESP8266/ESPNow_Master_ESP8266.ino (somewhat more complex ESP-NOW usage).
